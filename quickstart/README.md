## Start here

1. To get a feeling what preCICE does, [go to the cinema](http://run.precice.org/).
2. Get and install preCICE. For standard systems, this is pretty easy. Just pick what suits you best on [this overview page](installation-overview.html). Facing any problems? [Ask for help](community-channels.html).
3. Build and couple two [C++ solverdummies](https://github.com/precice/precice/tree/master/examples/solverdummies/cpp).
4. Install OpenFOAM. On many systems (e.g. Ubuntu), there are binary packages for OpenFOAM: `sudo apt-get install openfoam`
5. Download and install the [OpenFOAM-preCICE adapter](adapter-openfoam-get.html).
6. [Couple OpenFOAM with OpenFOAM](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/wiki/Tutorial-for-CHT:-Flow-over-a-heated-plate). This testcase is part of the OpenFOAM adapter.
